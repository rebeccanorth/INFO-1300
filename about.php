      <div class="about">
        <p> Off the Chain by Jesse was started by Jesse, a freshman at Cornell University. Inspired by expensive name necklaces, I set out to create a more affordable and adorable necklace. One day, I decided to hook some letters on a chain, and Off the Chain was born. While the first few necklaces may not have been so great, I set out to perfect them, and keep improving day to day. I am based in Chappaqua, NY, but continue making necklaces while I am at school up in Ithaca, NY. Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:Offthechain101@gmail.com">Offthechain101@gmail.com</a> to ask me any questions about my necklaces, or inquiries about one's you may want!</p>
